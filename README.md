# DjangoDoctor
Simple Doctor API
Hello, This Demo app using Django Rest Framework
I used APIView because we have simple API we don't need to use advancied concept like generic views, Mixins, ViewSets ...
I maked multi language supoort using Database, also we can make it using external package like gettext and many others but I don't know how you want it
I added EXTRA Views Folder because some developer like this way.
